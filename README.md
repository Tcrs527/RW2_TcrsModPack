# RW2_TcrsModPack
A Modpack containing various spells and skills for RW2

To Install:
Find your Rift Wizard 2 Mods folder, probably located at:	\Steam\steamapps\common\Rift Wizard 2\RiftWizard2\mods
If you cannot find where Rift Wizard 2 is located, go to your steam library and right click on the Rift Wizard 2 game and select "Manage" and then "Browse Local Files".

Once you've found your Rift Wizard 2 mods folder, move the modpack folder, named "TcrsCustomModpack", to your mods folder.
If the folder has been renamed e.g. TcrsCustomModpack-main, rename the folder to TcrsCustomModpack. It should have the exact same name as the python file within named "TcrsCustomModpack.py", but without the .py extension.

Launch Rift Wizard 2. The command prompt (if enabled) will note any loaded content. If successful it will say TCRS's Custom Modpack Loaded. You can also open the spellbook to see if any new spells are there.

You must abandon any previous runs after installing this modpack, because they will not load properly.
